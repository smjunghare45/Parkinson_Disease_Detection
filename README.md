# Parkinson_Disease_Detection
Machine Learning Model to detect the Parkinson's disease of a person

This repository includes two files one is Parkinson Data file which is dataset for our project which I got from Kaggle Platform. The other is main code. In this project, I have trained the machine learning model using Support Vector Classifier.

Workflow :
- Parkinson Data Collection
- Data Pre-processing
- Train Test Split
- Data standardisation
- Which model to use? --> Support Vector Machine Classifier
- Model Training
- Model Evaluation

The Accuracy Score I received is 90.8% for training data and 90% for test data.
