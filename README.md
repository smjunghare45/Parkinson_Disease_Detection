Machine Learning Model to detect the Parkinson's disease of a person

Parkinson's Disease which is also called as 'Shaking Palsy' is adisease usually detected in old people. It's a brain disorder that causes unintended or uncontrollable movements, such as shaking, stiffness, and difficulty with balance and coordination.
This Model tells whether a person is affected to the disease or not with help of few parameters.

This repository includes two files one is Parkinson Data file which is dataset for our project which I got from Kaggle Platform. The other is main code. In this project, I have trained the machine learning model using Support Vector Classifier.

Workflow :
- Parkinson Data Collection
- Data Pre-processing
- Train Test Split
- Data standardisation
- Which model to use? --> Support Vector Machine Classifier
- Model Training
- Model Evaluation

The Accuracy Score I received is 90.8% for training data and 90% for test data.
